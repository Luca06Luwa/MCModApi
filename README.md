## Status

Currently, this project is still in VERY early development, so there won't be any builds for a while.

Stuff that needs to be implemented:
- [ ] Get basic api calling to minecraft working
- [ ] create test mod
- [ ] implement fabic api and fabric mod libraries
- [ ] implement neoforged api and neoforged mod libraries
- [ ] ???

**Note**: I will try to update this README whenever I can. When something changes, I will add that here.
